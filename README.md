# Decentralized_AI_Voting_System
Decentralized AI Voting System with Cross-Chain Governance 
Objective: To build a cross-chain Dapp that allows users to propose, vote and execute governance decisions using AI-enhanced analytics. It utilizes the warden protocol features for secure AI integration and will leverage axelar for crosss-chain communication.
Features: 
AI-Driven proposals to evaluate and propose optimal decisions such as treasury management. 
Cross-chain Voting where users from different blockchains can participate in governance process thanks to axelar capabilities.
Secure voting ensuring transparency.

**SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT**

Done using solidity 
key factors in the development are 
->governance mechanism which allows users to submit proposals, vote and execute decisions.
->AI Model integration via wardens intents
->Enable cross-chain interactions via axelar using GMP  the contract will pass the voting results and execution orders between chains

**Technical Requirements**

-Solidity for samrt contracts.
-Warden protocol for AI model integration and key management.
-Axelar: cross-chain communication and governance.
node.js/react: front end for users to interact with DApp.
